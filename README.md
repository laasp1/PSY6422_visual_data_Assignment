Title: Equality of hourly wages? Gender pay gap in EU countries

Description: 
The gender paygap is a well documented issue, which has been heavily debated, especially in the last few years. Throughout history, women have been subjugated to receiving lower hourly wage than men. While the roles of women in today's society have changed, we still continue to receive less pay than men doing the same job. This data is therefore looking at many countries in the EU (including UK before 2018) between 2010 and 2020. This data was reported by Eurostat. This data visualization project demonstrates the EU countries which pay men and women similar wages compared to those with a large pay gap. The data is presented as a percent of gender pay gap.

This project demonstrates which countries have more and less of a gender pay gap.This allows us to compare the individual countries against each other as well as comparing the individual countries against themselves between 2010 and 2018. Secondly, this project focuses on the UK, comparing the change in gender pay gap from 2010 till 2018 between the average of all EU countries and the Unites Kindgom.
